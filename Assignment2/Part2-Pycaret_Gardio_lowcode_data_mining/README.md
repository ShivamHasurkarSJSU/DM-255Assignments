**Pycaret + Gradio - Low code Data mining**

Use of Pycaret to do low code Data Mining. Using full automl capabilities of pycaret. 

I have create a folder for each task which has its own dataset and .ipynb file and screenshots.

(for Binary Classification and Regression I have also used Gradio to create model and app of the best suitable model, have added screenshots in those folders.)

* **Binary Classification** - used Apple stock data to predict if the stock will go high or low.
* **Multiclass Classification** - used Data of Celestial Objects from Sloan Digital Sky survey to classify object as Star, Galaxy or QSO
* **Regression** - used Apple stock dataset to predict opening value of next day
* **Clustering** - used Data of Celestial Objects from Sloan Digital Sky survey to group object as Star, Galaxy or QSO
* **Anomaly Detection** - used credit card transaction dataset to analyze anomaly or frauds.
* **Association Rules Mining** - used shopping items like bread, butter, milk, etc dataset.
* **Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables** - used Apple stock data.
* **Time Series Forecasting - Univariate with Exogenous Variables** - used Apple stock data.
