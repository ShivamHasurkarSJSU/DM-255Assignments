**Pycaret + Gradio - Low code Data mining**

Use of Pycaret to do low code Data Mining. Using full automl capabilities of pycaret. 

I have create a folder for each task which has its own dataset and .ipynb file and screenshots.

(for Binary Classification and Regression I have also used Gradio to create model and app of the best suitable model, have added screenshots in those folders.)

* Binary Classification - used Apple stock data to predict if the stock will go high or low.
* Multiclass Classification - used Data of Celestial Objects from Sloan Digital Sky survey to classify object as Star, Galaxy or QSO
* Regression - used Apple stock dataset to predict opening value of next day
* Clustering - used Data of Celestial Objects from Sloan Digital Sky survey to group object as Star, Galaxy or QSO
* Anomaly Detection - used credit card transaction dataset to analyze anomaly or frauds.
* Association Rules Mining - used a New York city bike dataset to associate initital point of travel with bike id, analyzing transition patterns of citizens.
* Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables - 
* Time Series Forecasting - Univariate with Exogenous Variables -
